I would like to begin by thanking my thesis advisor, Professor Pallavi Jayawant for not only pushing me to be a better mathematician, but also for believing in me. This has been a truly wonderful experience. Thank you for sharing it with me.\\

My major advisor, Professor Chip Ross, in whose class I first experience the thrill of solving a proof and the sublime beauty of mathematics.\\

My roommates Jordana Gluckow and Jake Barbato for catching typos, bringing me food from Commons, and listening to me drone on endlessly about my thesis.\\

Eric Towne and Will Ash, without whom I could not have recovered my corrupted files.\\

My friends Ben Gilmore, Arnaud Cluzel, Matthew Neal, Maxwell Goldfarb, Darnell Morrow, Ali Hakasui, Alex Donatelle, Charlie McKitrick, Hannah Kiesler, and the Men's Water Polo Team for their constant love and support.\\

Finally, I would like to thank my family; Mom, Dad, Shane, and Emme. I love you all.
